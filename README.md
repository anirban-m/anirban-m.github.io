    + [benchmarking2DHubbard](/unitary-disentanglement-RG/benchmarking2DHubbard)
    In the folder we have placed a ipython notebook that demonstrates how to carry out the RG numerically for the Hubbard model
    by iterating the RG equations. From the fixed point solutions we compute the ground state energy density for zero doping and 12.5 % doping via a finite size scaling plot. The numerical values are in excellent agreement with those presented by the Simon's collaboration [LeBlanc.et.al](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.5.041041).
      + [Main Concept behind the Unitary RG](https://xp7orer.github.io/unitary-disentanglement-RG/benchmarking2DHubbard/preliminaries.html)
        This page gives a introduction to the RG formalism via demonstrating the essential concept of Hamiltonian block diagonalization via unitary transformations. The formalism is presented in complete detail in our arxiv work [arxiv-1802.06528](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06528)
