# unitary-disentanglement-RG
A unitary renormalization group for correlated fermion systems

We numerically implement here a unitary circuit that disentangles one electronic state from an entangled system at each transformation step. Arranging the steps from high to low energies leads to a renormalization group framework.

Upon using the formalism on the Hamiltonian yields a simpler effective model. And its application on the eigenspace leads to entanglement renormalization.
